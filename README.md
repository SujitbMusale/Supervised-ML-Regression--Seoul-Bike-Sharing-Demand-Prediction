# Supervised-ML-Regression--Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
This is capston project on supervised machine learning by using regression.
we can say that we implemented various models like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting on the dataset. . Out of all the built model, random forest and gradient boosting hypertuned via GridSearchCV model performed really well for this dataset with r2 score of 98.85% and 91.3% for random forest train and test dataset, for gradient boosting we achieved r2 score of 94.72%, 91.01% respectively. Although, Linear, lasso ,ridge and Decision Tree has comparatively less r2_score of round 74% for all There were many outliers in the dependent variable which were fixed using square root transformation. The most important features which effect the rented bike count is temperature and dew point temperature.
